# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to create my own game on python. I was thinking how going with a classic game of hangman which would consist of using loops to execute the play function and also using the print functions to create the image of the hangman, which we used a concept in the ealier weeks of this course to create an image, which was our first lab. So I would be building upon what we had worked on in Lab 1, which is one of my favorite concepts we've learned in class so far. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan on owrking by myself for this project as I usually tend to do better on my own rather than a group because from past experiences I would worry about my other team memebers reaching deadlines on time when I would complete my side of the work on time. Also with how this sem is running, I find it best just to work on this myself because my schedule might not align with my other team mates if I were to work in a group.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

1.Would this be acceptable to do for this project?
2.Would it be hard to create this type of program? 
3.Would the code be a bit longer than what this project criteria is looking for?
